    Hi, I've been using your app for a few months but am really having a problem with it working properly! We ran a big sale yesterday and some of our orders are missing customized options, which is a BIG problem because we don't know what the customer selected!!! Can you look into this ASAP and tell me if it can be fixed? Thanks...

Hello Customer:

Thank you for contacting us. I'm sorry that you're having problems, but there wasn't anything on our end that happened yesterday. I don't know why you encountered an issue. We cannot fix the orders that were already placed. I can look into this to see if there's anything that might need to be fixed. Send over admin credentials to your site and I'll look into it.

Regards,
Teammate
